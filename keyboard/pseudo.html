Create an empty HTML file called index.html.
In the head of the HTML file, include a link to a CSS file that will style the virtual keyboard.
In the body of the HTML file, create a div element with a class of "keyboard" that will contain the virtual keyboard.
In the JavaScript file, create an object that contains two arrays of characters for each language layout (English and another language).
Create a function that will generate the virtual keyboard HTML dynamically based on the language layout array. This function should loop through the array and create buttons for each character, and assign each button a class name and data attribute with the corresponding character.
Append the generated virtual keyboard HTML to the "keyboard" div element.
Create a function that will listen for keydown events on the document. This function should check if the pressed key corresponds to a character on the virtual keyboard, and if so, highlight the corresponding button.
Create a function that will listen for keyup events on the document. This function should unhighlight any buttons that were previously highlighted.
Create a function that will listen for click events on the virtual keyboard buttons. This function should add the clicked character to the text area.
Create functions for handling special keys like arrow keys, Enter, Tab, Backspace, and Del. These functions should manipulate the text area based on the key pressed.
Create a function that will switch the language layout of the virtual keyboard when a keyboard shortcut is pressed (e.g. Ctrl + Shift).
Store the chosen language layout in local storage so that it persists after the page is reloaded.
Add animations to the virtual keyboard to make it more user-friendly.
Test the virtual keyboard thoroughly to ensure that it functions as intended.
